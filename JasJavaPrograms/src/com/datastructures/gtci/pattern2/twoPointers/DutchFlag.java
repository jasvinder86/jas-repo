/*
 * Dutch National Flag Problem
 *
 * Given an array containing 0s, 1s and 2s, sort the array in-place.
 * You should treat numbers of the array as objects, hence, we canâ€™t count 0s, 1s, and 2s to recreate the array.
 * The flag of the Netherlands consists of three colors: red, white and blue; and since our input array also consists of three different
 * numbers that is why it is called Dutch National Flag problem.
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input: [1, 0, 2, 1, 0]
 * Output: [0, 0, 1, 1, 2]
 *
 * Example 2:
 * Input: [2, 2, 0, 1, 2, 0]
 * Output: [0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 2,]

//        1. Maintain two pointers for 0 and 2. Objective is to get the 0s at the lowest index by swapping the upcoming 0 with the low index and
//        then incrementing this index so that the next 0 encountered gets a position at (low+1)th index to be placed at.
//        Similarly, all the 2s should be moved to the high index by swapping the upcoming 2 with the high index and then this index be decremented
//        so that the next upcoming 2 gets to be placed at high--.
//        After the end of the above operation, all 0s will be shifted to the LHS, 2s to be at RHS making all 1s to be in the middle.
